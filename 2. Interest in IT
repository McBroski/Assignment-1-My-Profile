    <p>I have an interest in computer related information and how things work in a digital world. My interest in IT started in primary school when I learnt how to code simple things on Code.org (if I remember correctly, it was something to do with moving a Minecraft character around). Ever since then, I was interested in how computers understood certain commands and so further stepped into the computing world. I chose RMIT because they ran some very interesting courses on computer programming and Information Technology. I hoped that by completing these courses, I would gain some knowledge as to where I would like to go in the world of computers and digital information. I didn’t really expect anything much as to what I would learn but it always is something that’s new for me.<p/>
